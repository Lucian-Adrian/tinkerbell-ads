## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Guerrilla Marketing Seeds**
20 carefully selected seed keywords ensuring diverse script generation:
- unconventional_approach

- 0.5 (balanced)
- 0.65 (more creative)
- 0.8 (very creative)

### 3. **ViralCheck Scoring Formula**
```
final_score = (0.45 × llm_score) + (0.35 × trend_score) + (0.20 × viral_score)
```

### 4. **Complete Validation**
Every API endpoint has Zod validation schemas:
- URL validation

## 🎨 System Design Highlights

### Ultra-Organized Structure
Every file has a clear purpose and location:
- **types/** - Only types
- **lib/constants/** - Only constants
- **lib/utils/** - Only utilities
- **lib/ai/** - Only AI services
- **lib/supabase/** - Only database operations
- **components/ui/** - Only base UI components
- **components/personas/** - Only persona-related components

### Separation of Concerns
- Business logic in **services/**
- Data access in **supabase/database/**
- AI calls in **ai/**
- API routes in **app/api/**
- UI in **components/**

### Reusability
- Every utility is a pure function
- Every constant is exportable
- Every type is reusable
- Every component will be composable
