- **100+ individual files** each with single responsibility
- **Clear naming conventions** for easy navigation
- **Nested categorization** (e.g., components/ui/button/, lib/ai/prompts/persona/)

Key directories:
- src/app/ - Next.js routes (auth, dashboard, API)
- src/components/ - React components (ui, forms, dashboard, realtime)
- src/lib/ - Core libraries (supabase, ai, workers, services, utils)
- supabase/ - Database migrations and functions
- workers/ - Standalone worker application
- 	ests/ - Unit, integration, and E2E tests

## 🗄️ Database Design

**8 core tables:**
1. companies - Store company information
2. personas - Generated buyer personas
3. script_batches - Track script generation jobs
4. scripts - Generated ad scripts
5. scores - Scoring data (trend, LLM, viral)
6. assets - Generated image/video briefs
7. jobs - Background job tracking
8. campaigns - Campaign management (Phase 2)

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
- Comprehensive indexes for performance
- Database functions for common operations
- Triggers for auto-updating timestamps
- JSONB columns for flexible data

## 🤖 AI Integration

**Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration:**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

  - Asset brief generation

**Creative Angles:**
1. Problem-Solution
2. Social Proof
3. Contrarian
4. Data-Driven
5. Story-Driven

## 🔄 Worker System

**Bull Queue Jobs:**
1. Scraper - Web scraping job
2. Persona - Persona generation (triggered after scraping)
3. Script - Script generation (triggered per persona)
4. Scoring - Score calculation
5. Asset - Asset brief generation

**Features:**
- Priority-based job processing
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Job progress tracking
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs
- Real-time status updates via Supabase

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
