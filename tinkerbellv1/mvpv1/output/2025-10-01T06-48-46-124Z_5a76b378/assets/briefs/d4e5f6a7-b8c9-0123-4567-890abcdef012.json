On the left (or background, subtly fading), depict a performance marketing manager (Alex Chen persona, mid-30s, professional attire) looking overwhelmed, surrounded by chaotic, physical spreadsheets, cluttered data charts, and a ticking clock. The color palette here should be muted, perhaps sepia or desaturated. On the right (or foreground, brightly lit), the same manager, now calm and focused, interacts with a sleek, modern digital dashboard displaying clear, concise performance metrics and an AI icon, rendered in clean blues and whites (brand colors). The overall impression should be a transition from manual drudgery to intelligent, time-saving automation. The image should convey 'reclaiming time' and 'focusing on strategy' through visual metaphors.",
