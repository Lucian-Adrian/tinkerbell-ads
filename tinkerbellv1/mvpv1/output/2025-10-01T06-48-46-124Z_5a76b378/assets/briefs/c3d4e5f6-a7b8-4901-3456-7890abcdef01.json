On the left, a cluttered, dimly lit desk with overflowing spreadsheets and a slightly overwhelmed performance marketing manager (mid-30s, professional attire, diverse ethnicity, representing Alex Chen persona) struggling with manual data analysis. Subtle red/orange hues in this section to denote struggle. On the right, a bright, clean, and modern digital dashboard displaying clear, actionable performance ad insights with dynamic graphs and charts, predominantly in brand blue and white. A confident, focused marketer (same person as left, now empowered) is interacting with this screen. A subtle, transparent overlay of a 'rival' icon or a rising competitive graph element is visible on the right side, implying outmaneuvering. The overall aesthetic should be professional, clean, and convey a clear transition from chaos to clarity and competitive advantage. Use brand colors: blue, white, black.",
