On the left/problem side: The manager appears overwhelmed and stressed, surrounded by multiple computer screens displaying dense, chaotic, and complex performance marketing data (e.g., cluttered spreadsheets, confusing graphs, raw numbers). The color palette here should lean towards desaturated tones with hints of red or orange to convey stress. On the right/solution side: The same manager now appears calm, focused, and empowered. They are interacting with a single, clean, and intuitive digital dashboard (representing the 'Example Domain' tool) displaying clear, actionable data-driven insights (e.g., simplified graphs, key metrics highlighted in blue or green). The background is clean, modern, and predominantly uses brand colors (blue, white, black). A subtle upward trend arrow or a 'lightbulb' icon could appear over the solution side, symbolizing clarity and efficiency. The overall tone is informative, showing a clear problem-solution narrative.",
