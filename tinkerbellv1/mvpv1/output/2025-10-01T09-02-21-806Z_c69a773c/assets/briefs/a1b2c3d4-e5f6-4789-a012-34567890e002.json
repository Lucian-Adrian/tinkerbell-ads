On one side (representing 'slow ad cycles'), depict a frustrated marketing professional at a cluttered desk, surrounded by slow-loading screens, complex spreadsheets, or tangled wires, conveying manual, inefficient processes. Use muted, desaturated colors. On the other side (representing 'instant iteration'), show a confident professional interacting with a sleek, modern digital interface. This interface displays rapidly iterating ad creatives, real-time performance graphs with an upward trend, and a clean, intuitive dashboard. Use vibrant, bright colors with subtle motion lines or light trails to emphasize speed and efficiency.
